> [!NOTE]
> if you encounter the problem "3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app?"
> it means your application has loaded two different React instances. This breaks React Hooks, which rely on a single, shared state.
> Run this to connect to react in your testing project

```npm
npm link <path_to_your_testing_project>/node_modules/react
```
